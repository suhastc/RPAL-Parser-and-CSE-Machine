# RPAL-Parser-and-CSE-Machine
The objective of Project 1 is to implement a lexical analyzer, and a recursive descent parser for the RPAL language. The objective of Project 2 is to implement the sub-tree (partial) standardizer, and the 13-rule CSE machine.

RPAL INTERPRETER:
-----------------
- To Compile:

  >> make


- Usage: for Project 2
- ---------------------
- 
- ./p2 [-ast] [-st] [-r] filename

  -ast generates  Abstract Syntax Tree
  -st  generates Standardized Tree
  -r   runs the code
